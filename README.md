# Microsoft-malware-prediction-using-kaggle-dataset
The goal of the project is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine.

Each row corresponds to a machine. HasDetections variable indicates that Malware was detected on the machine.

We would use different machine learning models in order to make the predictions.

Microsoft is providing Kaggle with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage.open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.
